# CSS Guidelines

When writing CSS for any project we have a few overarching guidelines. These are applied throughout this document, so please make sure you're familiar with these concepts and structures before continuing.

* All CSS should be written using SASS with the `.scss` extension
* All CSS should following the `block`, `element`, `modifier` or [BEM](http://csswizardry.com/2013/01/mindbemding-getting-your-head-round-bem-syntax/) pattern of writing styles
* All CSS should be [namespaced](http://csswizardry.com/2015/03/more-transparent-ui-code-with-namespaces/) accordingly
